To prevent unwanted access to one's computer and personal information, passwords are the first line of security. The greater the password security, the better the computer's defence against hackers and dangerous software. Therefore, it is important to keep strong passwords for all of your computer accounts, especially in this day and age when technology is widely used and we need to set passwords for a lot of different accounts to complete even the smallest chores. A complex and long password will make it very difficult for a hacker to crack it, whether through a brute-force attack (trying every possible combination of numbers, letters, or special characters) or an automated machine attack trying thousands of combinations per second to guess your one and only. As a result, the more complex the password, the greater the security for your account. An account is where you keep a lot of sensitive information that you don't want stolen. As a result, safeguarding an account password is critical. Though there are many alternatives to passwords for access control, in many applications, the password is the more compellingly authenticating the identity.
